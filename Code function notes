Notes on functions and locations / when functions are called

80010d74 - called on .BIN start (very likely the main function)
80010d7c - called after main function finishes
80010da0 - called after main function finishes
80010e1c - 
80010e38 - called during main screen animation. seems to be used for drawing main screen / loading screen images
80010ea4 - called during start/restart of main screen animation. seems to be used for drawing main screen / loading screen images
80010ed4 - called during reset of main screen animation. for example, when loading screen times out and recalls 80010e38
  ALSO called when main screen animation is interrupted by controller input
80010f24 - questionable if 80010ed4 and 80010f24 are actually separate function. Ghidra and splat are giving weird results
  80010f24 is a fucking huge function - goes to address 80011078
  this function is used in tandem with 10e38, 10ea4 to draw main intro animation
      to see this, set breakpoints at 10e38, 10ea4, and 10f24 during intro animation
  *confirmed that 10f24 and 10ed4 are different functions
  10ed4 is called when the opening animation ENDS (and starts?)
8001107c - called when opening animation resumes after time-out on main loading screen OR when opening animation ends
