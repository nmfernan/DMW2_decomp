Notes on functions and locations / when functions are called

80010d74 - called on .BIN start (very likely the main function)
80010d7c - 
80010da0 - 
80010e1c - 
80010e38 - called during main screen animation. seems to be used for drawing main screen / loading screen images
80010ea4 - called during start/restart of main screen animation. seems to be used for drawing main screen / loading screen images
80010ed4 - called during reset of main screen animation. for example, when loading screen times out and recalls 80010e38
80010f24 - questionable if 80010ed4 and 80010f24 are actually separate function. Ghidra and splat are giving weird results
  80010f24 is a fucking huge function - goes to address 80011078
8001107c -
