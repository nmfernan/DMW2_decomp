Digimon World 2
Relased for Sony PSX July 27th 2000 (JP) & May 19th 2001 (USA)
Assumptions and general information
Compiler: probably GCC 2.95.2 or 2.95.1 based on release date -- new information makes it seem like compiler was likely V2.8 (big thanks to mkst)

Looking at SLUS_011.93, it seems likely that most of the game code resides from 0x80010D74 to 0x80040D6C / 80040CF4
  Looking at locations after 80040D6C seem to contain a lot of "unknown" ops when looking in memory viewers such as Mednafen or PSX-Redux, because it's data (assumedly)

They have made many wonderful ROM Hacks with this :)
